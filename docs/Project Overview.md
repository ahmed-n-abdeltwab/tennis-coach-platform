# Project Overview

## Tennis Coach Booking and Management Platform

This project is a sophisticated web application designed for professional tennis coaches, enabling them to showcase experience, streamline client bookings, and efficiently manage all facets of their coaching business. The system sets a new standard in usability, automation, and design—drawing on the latest trends in website engineering for sports professionals.

### Key Features

- **Modern UI/UX:** Inspired by high-end coaching and fitness sites, the platform uses a clean, responsive layout with a black and orange color scheme for energy and professionalism. Scroll-triggered animations, smooth transitions, and prominent coach imagery create a strong first impression and help build client trust.
  
- **Coach Profile & Introduction:** The homepage features a dynamic introductory section highlighting the coach’s history, credentials, and coaching philosophy, along with high-quality photos. This direct, benefit-focused messaging lets visitors know what sets the coach apart and who the services are for.
  
- **Advanced Booking System:** Users can register, create secure accounts, and book sessions (training or consultancy), selecting from the coach’s real-time availability. Prices, client notes, and discount codes are integrated into the booking flow. The system restricts bookings to logged-in users to ensure data integrity and service security.
  
- **Automated Scheduling:** The coach sets available time slots, which are dynamically shown to users. Meetings are automatically scheduled in both parties' Google Calendars upon payment, streamlining client onboarding and follow-up.
  
- **Payment Integration:** The site features PayPal gateway support, allowing users to book and pay for sessions securely online. Automated confirmation and notifications, both in-app and via email, optimize payment tracking and transparency.
  
- **User Data & CRM:** Comprehensive user registration captures email, gender, age, height, weight, disability status, country, and address, supporting personalized coaching and robust data management. The coach has access to client CRM features to review histories, track appointments, and offer custom programs.
  
- **Discount Campaigns & Offers:** The admin dashboard lets the coach create and manage discount codes, time-limited offers, and special campaigns, with usage and expiration tracking to incentivize bookings and reward loyal clients.
  
- **Live Communication:** An in-app chat supports direct coach-client messaging when users are logged in, enhancing engagement. Coaches can send offers, updates, and session feedback via chat and email, and clients receive appointment details instantly.
  
- **Admin Control Panel:** Coaches (admins) have a powerful dashboard to manage all aspects of their online presence—editing content, tracking bookings, modifying pricing, viewing analytics, and controlling discounts and offers.
  
- **Security & Engineering:** Robust data validation, session management, and access controls protect user information. Client-side persistence using localStorage ensures smooth interaction. The solution uses scalable, maintainable code architecture, supporting future feature expansion.
